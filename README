WWW-Selenium-Utils version 0.01
===============================

This package contains useful helper libraries and scripts for 
testing websites using Selenium.

  http://selenium.thoughtworks.com

The scripts/selenium-regen script can be used to automatically 
convert test scripts written in a simple wiki-like table markup 
into the html tables that Selenium expects.

Sample .wiki file:

  Test Title
  | open | /foo |
  | verifyLocation | /foo | 
  | verifyTextPresent | id=name | Luke |
  # comments are allowed

  # so are blank lines
  | clickAndWait | id=main_btn |

You may wish to use scripts/selenium-regen (eg: put it in your ~/bin),
and/or use something similar that finds Selenium in your environment.

This package contains two modules:

  WWW::Selenium::Utils
    generate_suite() - converts wiki files, creates TestSuite.html

  WWW::Selenium::Utils::CGI
    run() - runs a command, returns the output
    cat() - dump the contents of a file

    You will need to wrap these functions in CGI or mod_perl handlers.
